# TASK 2:API

API stands for Application Programming Interface, acts as a middleman between two software applications. It provides a set of rules and speciﬁcations that allow programs to communicate with each other and exchange data or functionality.

There are two types of API:

Data APIs: These APIs provide access to speciﬁc data sets or information. For example, a weather API might provide access to real-time weather data for a particular location.

Functional APIs: These APIs allow applications to call upon speciﬁc functionalities oﬀered by another service. For instance, a mapping API might provide functionalities for displaying interactive maps within an application.Imade weather app using api key and javascript

![](media/1d507877ef26db78d85fffec62951a46.png)AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a powerful technique used to make requests to servers and retrieve data without reloading the entire webpage. This allows for a more dynamic and user-friendly web experience.

# TASK 7:CREATE A PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

![](media/8bccc42fbefd21c9162d0586e8a42588.jpeg)The objective was to create a portfolio using HTML and CSS.With the help of AI I created a simple website and Used VS code as the platform to code

Key Learnings:

-   Revised html and CSS concepts and keywords.

TASK 8:WRITE A REPORT USING MARKDOWN

File corrupted

TASK 9: TINKERCAD

I got familiar with tinkercad and its interface.I did several circuits with it and tried multiple tools and components with diﬀerent codes

Created a radar system utilizing an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to detect objects within a certain range.

The ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and measures the time taken for them to bounce back, while the servo motor rotates the sensor to cover a wider area, providing a simple yet eﬀective detection mechanism

# TASK 10: SPEED CONTROL OF DC MOTOR USING UNO AND L298N

About main components L298N:

The L298N is a dual H-bridge integrated circuit (IC) commonly used for controlling DC motor direction and speed with an Arduino board.It can handle two DC motor and one bipolar stepper motor.By applying diﬀerent logic signals (HIGH or LOW) to these pins, you can control the direction of rotation and enable/disable the motor.

![](media/931821a91c3b3f90c24cea3782d91c98.jpeg)

Arduino:

It is a circuit board which allows the user to program inorder to control the electronic components like DC motors.

It helps in the method of Pulse Width Modulation which is a technique where a digital signal rapidly switches between on and oﬀ states.The ratio of the on time to the total cycle time (period) determines the average voltage delivered to the motor.By varying the pulse width using Arduino's PWM pins, we can control the average voltage supplied to the motor, thereby aﬀecting its speed.

Other components

-   DC Motor (voltage and current rating compatible with L298N)

![](media/bc858ba5e5c3e24b7ac626013dda0fdd.jpeg)

Ground (GND): Connects to circuit's ground like negative on a battery. Trigger (TRG): Starts the timer in one-shot mode or inﬂuences it in others. Output (OUT): Where the timer signal comes out (pulse, wave, or on/oﬀ). Reset (RESET): Pushes the timer to stop and clear, like a big red button.

Control (CTRL): Fine-tune timing speed in some modes

Threshold (THR): Works with trigger to set the timing ﬁnish line.

Discharge (DIS): Helps clear the timer after a pulse or oﬀers advanced control.

Power (VCC): Plugs the chip in, like connecting it to a power source.
